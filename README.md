# Final-Project
Welcome to our Software Carpentry final project!

Group member: Dake Guo, Yu Xu


The project is a puzzle game. 
It is set to three levels: lower level (L), medium level (M), and hard level (H). 
The puzzle consists of grid size of 3 x 3, 4 x 4 and 5 x 5, corresponding to the difficulties of the three levels, respectively.
The puzzles are created from the images in the repository. 
At the beginning of the game, there will be a puzzle grid of shuffled image. 
The objective of the game is to restore the image to the original one by arranging the blocks around the empty block.
Only the blocks around the one blank block can be arranged using the mouse or keyboard.
Once all the blocks are in the correct space, the empty block will be filled automatically and the game will be completed successfully.

There are no limits of time or attempts for the game. The game will only end when all the blocks are arranged correctly. 



# How to use it

In order to select the mode (lower level, medium level or hard level), simply press L/M/H on your keyboard to enter the game of 3 x 3, 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 puzzle, respectively. 
You can use your mouse or WASD to complete the puzzle. If you are using a mouse, the block being clicked on will move into the empty block. If you are using the keyboard, the direction indicated will be the direction that a block can move towards. Therefore, the block at the location that is opposite of the indicated direction will move into the empty space. 

In order to play the puzzle game, you will need this python file, the .TTF file and the images. All of which can be found in our repository.
